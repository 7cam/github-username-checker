# GitHub Username Checker (kinda broke, API ratelimits, fixing eventually)

This is a Python script that checks a list of GitHub usernames to see if they are available or taken. 

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a file called `usernames.txt` in the same directory as the script.
3. Add a list of GitHub usernames, one per line, to the `usernames.txt` file.
4. Run the script using `python3 checker.py`.
5. The script will output a list of usernames and whether they are available or taken.

## Requirements

This script requires the `requests` and `colorama` Python packages to be installed. You can install them using the following command:

```pip install requests colorama```
